These workers introduced the island to Chinese dishes like fried rice and sticky cakes called Nian Gao. Over time, these foods mixed with the traditional French dishes eaten by the settlers, creating unique new recipes.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century, the British captured the island. During the early years of British rule, slavery was still legal and African slaves started to join the population of Mauritius. These slaves brought their own flavors, too. When slavery was abolished in 1834, the British began recruiting \"indentured laborers\":/marginalia/ms-definition-indentured from \"India\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-india to replace the slaves. Hundreds of thousands of Indian people came to the island, bringing with them dishes like curries, roti, and samosas.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a diverse history, Mauritian food is packed with flavors because it was located along the \"Spice Route\":/marginalia/ms-definition-spice-route. In the 16th century, the French, British, and the Dutch began to buy spices from India and Southeast Asia to sell in Europe. Located in the \"Indian Ocean\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-indian-ocean, Mauritius was a popular spot to rest, eat, refuel, and trade. Eventually, spice plants like cinnamon and nutmeg sprung up in Mauritius, and all those flavors found their way into the food.\r\n\r\nMauritius is food-lovers paradise!  I&rsquo;ve tried food that I&rsquo;ve never seen anywhere else, like Bol Renverse, which is French for &ldquo;upside-down bowl.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBol Renverse contains meat or fish, veggies, and a fried egg on top of rice with oyster sauce. It&rsquo;s served in a bowl that is flipped upside down onto your plate. When it&rsquo;s time to eat, the bowl is taken off to reveal the delicious helping of food underneath. The oyster sauce is salty, sweet, and thick, with a slight fishy taste. \r\n\r\nMauritius is a real melting pot of global flavors - all you have to do is try the food here to understand!','	<p>One of the best ways to understand the diverse history of <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-mauritius\">Mauritius</a> is by eating the food.

With a mix of French, British, Indian, Chinese, and East African cooking, you can eat your way through Mauritian history!</p>\n\n	<p>The <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-netherlands\">Dutch</a> were the first to settle Mauritius in the 17th century, but they left pretty quickly and didn&rsquo;t really influence Mauritian cuisine.</p>\n\n	<p>Next came the French in the 18th century, along with workers from <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-china\">China</a> to help them build cities. These workers introduced the island to Chinese dishes like fried rice and sticky cakes called Nian Gao. Over time, these foods mixed with the traditional French dishes eaten by the settlers, creating unique new recipes.</p>\n\n	<p>In the 19th century, the British captured the island. During the early years of British rule, slavery was still legal and African slaves started to join the population of Mauritius. These slaves brought their own flavors, too. When slavery was abolished in 1834, the British began recruiting <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-indentured\">indentured laborers</a> from <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-india\">India</a> to replace the slaves. Hundreds of thousands of Indian people came to the island, bringing with them dishes like curries, roti, and samosas.</p>\n\n	<p>In addition to a diverse history, Mauritian food is packed with flavors because it was located along the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-spice-route\">Spice Route</a>. In the 16th century, the French, British, and the Dutch began to buy spices from India and Southeast Asia to sell in Europe. Located in the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-indian-ocean\">Indian Ocean</a>, Mauritius was a popular spot to rest, eat, refuel, and trade. Eventually, spice plants like cinnamon and nutmeg sprung up in Mauritius, and all those flavors found their way into the food.</p>\n\n	<p>Mauritius is food-lovers paradise!  I&rsquo;ve tried food that I&rsquo;ve never seen anywhere else, like Bol Renverse, which is French for &ldquo;upside-down bowl.&rdquo;</p>\n\n	<p>Bol Renverse contains meat or fish, veggies, and a fried egg on top of rice with oyster sauce. It&rsquo;s served in a bowl that is flipped upside down onto your plate. When it&rsquo;s time to eat, the bowl is taken off to reveal the delicious helping of food underneath. The oyster sauce is salty, sweet, and thick, with a slight fishy taste. </p>\n\n	<p>Mauritius is a real melting pot of global flavors &#8211; all you have to do is try the food here to understand!</p>','Explore the diverse culinary traditions of Mauritius, a combination of Chinese, French, and Indian influences.

The dodo bird went extinct after Dutch settlers brought rats, pigs, and monkeys to the island. These non-native species competed with the dodo for food and ate its eggs. Within 80 years, the dodo disappeared.</p>\n\n	<p>Like the famous, flightless dodo, all but one species of giant tortoise have also gone extinct. The Aldabra tortoise originally came from the <a href=\"/marginalia/ue-country-profile-seychelles\">Seychelles</a>. These giant sea creatures were once used as a food source. The Aldabra almost went extinct because sailors would herd them aboard their ships to serve as fresh food on long voyages.</p>\n\n	<p>Seeing these animals has made me more aware of how easily a small population can be wiped out by humans.</p>','','','','mauritius','',0,'',0,4,1,1,'upper-elementary','','','flora-fauna','57766896','57649750','','Jenny','','','','','','','08d87882d392bc4fbc0dffff13bb5020','2014-02-22'),

Sawasdee ka, explorers and welcome to \"Thailand\":marginalia/hs-country-profile-thailand, from your (almost) fearless guide, Tati!\r\n\r\nAlthough a relatively small country, Thailand&rsquo;s climate and landscape are very diverse. In \"Chiang Mai\":/marginalia/hs-th-definition-chiang-mai, in the north, one finds the country&rsquo;s highest mountain range, endless rice paddy fields, and lush rain forests. In \"Phuket\":/marginalia/hs-th-definition-phuket, in the south, there are long stretches of white-sand beaches and thick tropical trees. My journey begins here, in the sprawling city of \"Bangkok\":/marginalia/hs-th-definition-bangkok.\r\n\r\nWeary-eyed and disoriented from the time change, I am met by Pair, my guide for the majority of my three-week journey. Luckily, I remember to &lsquo;wai&rsquo;; pressing palms together and bowing my head slightly. This is the proper way to greet people in Thailand. In my past travel experiences, it&rsquo;s always an appreciated gesture by foreign cultures when I make an attempt to learn how to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in their native tongue. And bowing to one another as part of the proper salutation? I&rsquo;ve got that down! The same gesture is a sign of respect and humility in my native \"Ethiopian\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-ethiopia culture.\r\n\r\nDriving from the airport to the hotel, I stare out the window at the massive urban landscape. With approximately nine million people living in the city, Bangkok has a slightly larger urban population than New York City. Immediately, there is something about this city that makes me feel as though I&rsquo;m at home; bumper-to-bumper traffic, sidewalks crowded with pedestrians, and hundreds of skyscrapers seemingly vanish into the clouds.\r\n\r\nI continue over the \"Chao Phraya River\":/marginalia/hs-th-definition-chao-phraya-river, which cuts through the heart of Bangkok. Buildings and indecipherable signs flashing before my eyes, I catch a glimpse of Wat Arun, one of the many \"Buddhist\":/marginalia/hs-definition-buddhism temples my guidebook designates as a &ldquo;must-see&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nDespite warnings from friends that Bangkok is a bit unsavory, I certainly have not seen this side. Could this impression be merely misrepresentation in the media? The energy of the capital is palpable and the illuminated temples around which this city is built are majestic.

Thai chefs are known for creating harmonious flavor pairings using these primary components in all their dishes. Fish sauce is most commonly used for the salty component. This sauce is made by fermenting fish in jars, and using the fermenting liquid as a cooking additive. Kaffir limes can provide sourness, chilies add spice, and coconuts and pineapple often add sweetness. These flavors, along with various meats and vegetables, form classic Thai dishes such as curries, or stews, that can range from mild to very spicy.\r\n\r\nRice, or &lsquo;khao&rsquo; is a staple grain in most Asian cuisine. The Thai favorite, long-grain Jasmine rice, is indigenous to the country. Virtually all of the country&rsquo;s rice is produced in northeast Thailand where rice fields dominate the area&rsquo;s landscape. Thailand&rsquo;s reverence for rice stems from its cultural and economic impact. This relatively small country is not only one of the top global producers of rice, it&rsquo;s also the world&rsquo;s largest exporter of this grain. Yes, exporting even more than \"China\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-china and \"Vietnam\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-vietnam!\r\n\r\nWhile Thailand has its share of &lsquo;grab-n-go&rsquo; convenience stores, big-box supermarkets, and well-known fast-food chains, fresh markets thrive in this country that relies on locally produced/raised foods.\r\n\r\nFresh markets around the world are typically divided into two distinct sections: dry and wet. For example, in the dry section of \"Bangkok&rsquo;s\":/marginalia/hs-th-definition-bangkok Khlong Toei market, one can find everything from spicy Thai chilies to fragrant pomelos. The produce section is always a personal favorite, where brilliantly colored fruits are a feast for the eyes.\r\n\r\nIn stark contrast to the sweet-smelling air of the dry market, is the wet market. This section is customarily reserved for slimy and smelly goods - fish vendors and butchery shops. Certainly not for the squeamish (or vegetarians) some sections are a bit bloody, with poultry awaiting slaughter and raw meat for purchase.\r\n\r\nOn the periphery of some markets, small stands can be found which specialize in selling one item - the durian. Known as the &lsquo;King of Fruits&rsquo; it&rsquo;s intentionally kept in isolation from the intoxicating guavas, mangos, and other delectable fruits found in open-air markets. Simply put - it STINKS!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, my curiosity gets the best of me and I have to try one for myself. The durian&rsquo;s texture is surprising; similar to thick custard. With the first bite my taste buds are immediately inundated with hints of banana, nougat, and one particularly pungent (yet unidentifiable) flavor that does not agree with me. Thankfully, in the middle of the crowded market, it&rsquo;s not terribly offensive to spit out your food. \r\n\r\nWith the exception of the durian, nearly every bite I&rsquo;ve had is Aroi Mak Mak for sure, which means delicious!','	<p>The core of Thai cooking balances four essential flavors: salty, sour, spicy, and sweet.

It&rsquo;s hard to believe that, just a few hundred years ago, this island was nothing but wildlife and thick forests.	     \r\n	     \r\nHistorians believe that Arab sailors knew of Mauritius as far back as the 10th century, but it didn&rsquo;t appear on maps until around 1500.\r\n\r\nIn 1511, \"Portuguese\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-portugal sailors landed on Mauritius. The island started popping up on Portuguese maps with the name &ldquo;Cirne,&rdquo; but the Portuguese never settled in Mauritius. The next visitors came in 1598 - a group of Dutch sailors. They named it Mauritius after Maurice of Nassau, a Dutch prince, and claimed the island as it part of the \"Netherlands\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-netherlands.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dutch began establishing their first settlement in 1638, Mauritius was teeming with native wildlife. The island had grown out of a volcano in the heart of the Indian Ocean creating a place where plants and animals could evolve apart from the rest of the world.

However, one thing I don&rsquo;t often see are \"Buddhist\":/marginalia/ms-definition-buddhism temples.\r\n\r\nBuddhism is the main religion in Thailand with approximately 95% of the population practicing Theraveda Buddhism. Theravada, meaning the &lsquo;Ancient Teaching&rsquo;, began in \"Nepal\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-nepal in 250 BCE.\r\n\r\nUnlike \"Christianity\":/marginalia/ms-definition-christianity, \"Islam\":/marginalia/ms-definition-islam or \"Judaism\":/marginalia/ms-definition-judaism, Buddhism is a non-theistic religion. This means that its believers do not base their faith around a god. Instead, they study the teachings of a man named Siddh&atilde;rtha Gautama, or as he is more commonly known, the \"Buddha\":/marginalia/ms-definition-buddha.\r\n\r\nBuddhists believe that all humans are born into a cycle of reincarnation. This means that when a person dies, their soul returns through another human or living thing. According to the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings, the ultimate goal of life is to break free of this cycle of death and rebirth. Buddhists believe that you can get off of the wheel of reincarnation if you lead a pure life, which leads to nirvana. Simply put, nirvana is a state of perfect happiness. Understanding different religions can be difficult, and to me, nirvana sounds similar to the Christian belief of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Thai people are incredibly dedicated to the Buddhist faith. This can be seen through the more than 30,000 Buddhist temples, or wats, across Thailand.  One of the most famous is Wat Pho. Built in the 1780s, it is both the oldest and largest temple in \"Bangkok\":/marginalia/ms-th-definition-bangkok.

Instead, they study the teachings of a man named Siddh&atilde;rtha Gautama, or as he is more commonly known, the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-buddha\">Buddha</a>.</p>\n\n	<p>Buddhists believe that all humans are born into a cycle of reincarnation. This means that when a person dies, their soul returns through another human or living thing. According to the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings, the ultimate goal of life is to break free of this cycle of death and rebirth. Buddhists believe that you can get off of the wheel of reincarnation if you lead a pure life, which leads to nirvana. Simply put, nirvana is a state of perfect happiness. Understanding different religions can be difficult, and to me, nirvana sounds similar to the Christian belief of heaven.</p>\n\n	<p>The Thai people are incredibly dedicated to the Buddhist faith. This can be seen through the more than 30,000 Buddhist temples, or wats, across Thailand.  One of the most famous is Wat Pho. Built in the 1780s, it is both the oldest and largest temple in <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-th-definition-bangkok\">Bangkok</a>. Inside, there is a golden reclining Buddha that measures over 140 feet long and almost 50 feet high. To give you an idea of its size &#8211; this Buddha statue is equal to the length of three school buses and as tall as a 5-story building!</p>\n\n	<p>Just across the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-th-definition-chao-phraya-river\">Chao Phraya River</a> is Wat Arun, which was constructed in 18th century. In the heart of Wat Arun, stands a beautiful 260-foot high tower called the &lsquo;Temple of the Dawn.&rsquo; I find the name misleading; personally, think it looks most beautiful at sunset. As you will see in the video, this greyish, ceramic tile encrusted temple seems to come alive as the sun goes down and the structure lights up.</p>','Explore Bangkok\'s Buddhist temples, and get a quick history of Buddhism.

Similar to the feudal system in Europe, haciendas in \"M&eacute;xico\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-mexico were owned by the nobility, employed local peoples in agriculture and production, and formed the basis of the economic system for hundreds of years. Prior to haciendas, agriculture and mining were used to support the local population. Suddenly, with the arrival of the Spanish, the country had demand for its exports overseas. \r\n\r\nWhile haciendas in M&eacute;xico date as far back as the 16th century, they flourished from the 1800s to early 1900s. Those focused on producing agricultural products were prevalent.\r\n\r\nWith a minimum of 2500 acres, hacienda owners (called hacendados) couldn&rsquo;t work their fields alone and brought in workers to live on and work at their estate. At first, these workers came from the surrounding areas. Then, to meet the growing demand for laborers, workers began to come from overseas. These large privately owned properties operated more like autonomous cities than businesses or farms; each had its own school, store, health facility, and chapel. The hacienda system reminded me of America&rsquo;s southern tobacco and cotton plantations that functioned around the same time period. However, workers on the hacienda weren&rsquo;t slaves, but were dependent on the hacendado, like a serf with his lord.\r\n\r\nAfter falling into disuse in the early 1900s, most haciendas remained abandoned until the early 21st century, when many were restored to be used as hotels and restaurants.

In fact, this was the main product of the majority of haciendas in the Yucat&aacute;n. Henequ&eacute;n is a fiber that&rsquo;s harvested from leaves of agave plants and is used to make rope and twine. From cutting the spiky, fleshy leaves of the agave plant to the bale press, this multi-step process of turning plant to product has only slightly evolved since the 19th century.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, before the hacienda system began its rapid decline, the Yucat&aacute;n had more than 200 factories for processing henequ&eacute;n. In the 1950s, with the invention of synthetic fibers, henequ&eacute;n production came to a virtual standstill. Today, there are fewer than 20 factories that produce henequ&eacute;n.\r\n\r\n*Fun Fact:* Henequ&eacute;n is also called sisal, which comes from the name of the Yucat&aacute;n port from which the henequ&eacute;n was often shipped out.

Why hasn&rsquo;t a similar wall been proposed for the US/Canada border? What other international walls can you think of, current or historic? Why were they built? Were they effective?</p>\n\n	<p><strong>Fact:</strong>  While undocumented workers are found in many jobs, most will find work that does not require extensive education or governmental licensing. For example, construction, farming, and service work like cleaning and food preparation have large percentages of undocumented workers. In the US it is illegal to employ an undocumented worker, and can be punished by fines and imprisonment.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>Consider these questions:</strong>  Why might an employer hire an undocumented worker? Why are these jobs (construction, farming, manufacturing, etc.) more likely to have undocumented workers than others? Would it change the US economy if undocumented labor was unavailable? If so, what are the possible economic effects?</p>\n\n	<p>Today&rsquo;s video is from a documentary called &ldquo;Border Stories&rdquo;. In this video Jose Nogales takes about how he was brought to America when he was two years old. At age 19, he was sent back to M&eacute;xico.</p>','Public interviews on immigration and border control and patrol. The Mexico series is presented by Vijaya Selvaraju and Jazmine Da Costa.

This celebration symbolizes a girl&rsquo;s transition into adulthood. The quince&ntilde;era is believed to draw from both ancient \"Aztec\":/marginalia/ms-definition-aztec rites of passage and European traditions. Following the conquest, the Spanish forced many religious beliefs on to the native people. One of these required a girl, on her fifteenth birthday, to devote her life to the Catholic church or to marry. Today, thankfully, girls celebrating their fifteenth birthday&rsquo;s are no longer required to make this huge decision.\r\n\r\nThe quincea&ntilde;era is both a religious event and a social event with the religious portion comprised of a church Mass or prayer ceremony for the girl and her family.

What was the purpose of these two massive pyramids and the surrounding structures?\r\n\r\nAt its peak (around 500 CE to 600 CE) Teotihu&aacute;can was home to approximately 200,000 Aztec people, about the same population as modern-day Montgomery, Alabama.

The sheer volume of the Pyramid of the Sun was sensational. There are about 250 steps to climb in order to reach the summit, making it the largest _climbable_ pyramid in the world.

Those focused on farming were the most popular.\r\n\r\nEach hacienda had at least 2,500 acres of land, which made it impossible for the owner to plant, cultivate, and harvest the land alone. So, native Mexicans were employed. Sometimes, with more than 100 employees and their families, these large, privately-owned properties operated more like independent cities than businesses or farms. Each hacienda had its own school, store, health facility, and chapel.\r\n\r\nMost haciendas were closed or abandoned in the early 1900s, during the Mexican Revolution. Although neglected and dilapidated, many have been restored to be used as hotels and restaurants.

Why hasn&rsquo;t a similar wall been proposed for the US/Canada border? What other international walls can you think of, current or historic? Why were they built? Were they effective?</p>\n\n	<p><strong>Fact:</strong>  The US Congress is considering a law that could provide a legal path to citizenship for undocumented people. Those against this proposed law believe it is equal to rewarding bad behavior.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>Consider these questions:</strong> What should law enforcement officers do if they find an undocumented person living or working in the US? Does your answer change if the person found has been in the US for a month? A year? Ten years?</p>\n\n	<p>What&rsquo;s your point of view on these issues?</p>\n\n	<p>Today&rsquo;s video is from a documentary called &ldquo;Border Stories&rdquo;.

Many believe that the <a href=\"/marginalia/ue-country-profile-spain\">Spanish</a> used them as <a href=\"/marginalia/ue-definition-catholic\">Catholic</a> religion teaching tools. The original shape was a star with seven points. Each point represented a <a href=\"/marginalia/ue-definition-deadly-sins\">deadly sin</a>. Whacking the pi&ntilde;atas with a stick symbolized striking away evil and sin, and the candy inside represented the rewards of heaven.</p>\n\n	<p>Today, pi&ntilde;atas come in many different shapes, but the traditional stars are still popular designs around Christmas time.</p>\n\n	<p>Another important tradition is the Quincea&ntilde;era. The word quincea&ntilde;era comes from the Spanish words <em>quince</em>, which means fifteen and <em>anos</em>, which mean years. It celebrates a girl&rsquo;s 15th birthday and marks the start of her adult life.</p>\n\n	<p>The quincea&ntilde;era is similar to a sweet sixteen and a little like prom. It is both a religious event and a social event. The religious portion is a church Mass or prayer ceremony for the girl and her family. The social event is usually a large banquet or fiesta to celebrate the day. </p>\n\n	<p>It all starts with the dress. The color of a girl&rsquo;s dress determines the theme and style of her party. Everything from the invitations to the decorations centers around this one piece of clothing.</p>\n\n	<p>What are some of traditions in your family?	 </p>','','','','mexico','',0,'',0,4,1,1,'upper-elementary','','','tradiciones','88538232','89566050','','Jenny','','','','','','','2cdad49f6ff105ea8285db49913975e5','2014-03-03'),

With my previous international travel experience consisting solely of trips to <a href=\"/marginalia/hs-country-profile-canada\">Canada</a>, this is the furthest I have been from home.</p>\n\n	<p>After passing through <a href=\"/marginalia/hs-definition-passport-and-immigration\">immigration and passport control</a> and collecting my bags, I find my guide, Cromwell. I have been studying some basic words and phrases in two of the national languages &#8211; <a href=\"/marginalia/hs-za-definition-afrikaans\">Afrikaans</a> and <a href=\"/marginalia/hs-za-definition-xhosa\">Xhosa</a> &#8211; and excitedly practice them with Cromwell. </p>\n\n	<p>A nation that takes great pride in its diversity, South Africa has eleven official languages: English, Ndebele, <a href=\"/marginalia/hs-za-definition-zulu\">Zulu</a>, Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, Swati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, and the two I&rsquo;ve been practicing. While appreciative of my efforts to converse with him in his native tongue, Cromwell kindly informed me that my pronunciation is way off. He immediately begins to help me perfect the &lsquo;click&rsquo; sound, which is key to mastering the Xhosa language.</p>\n\n	<p>Driving through Johannesburg en route to the hotel, I notice the city&rsquo;s massive size. Though Johannesburg has a population of three million, the surrounding suburbs and neighborhoods blend into a &lsquo;unicity&rsquo; that totals almost nine million people. That&rsquo;s about equal size to America&rsquo;s most populous city, <a href=\"/marginalia/hs-definition-new-york-city\">New York City</a>!</p>\n\n	<p>My evening arrival prevents me from getting a good first look at Johannesburg, but aggressive home security measures are clearly visible even in the darkness. High, razor-wired walls surround houses emblazoned with security signs. Johannesburg has a reputation of being one of the most dangerous cities in the world. I&rsquo;m curious to learn if this is fact or merely media frenzy.</p>','ProjectExplorer.org welcomes you to South Africa. This chapter includes language lessons in Zulu and Xhosa.

At this point, Europeans had explored Africa and Asia and were seeking new trade routes and partners. Spices and tea were extremely valuable, and in some cases, worth more than their weight in gold. Seeking these enormous riches was a key motivation in hunting for new routes to <a href=\"http://projectexplorer.smartmediacreative.com/marginalia/hs-country-profile-india\">India</a> and the Far East.

Dangriga is the center of \"Garifuna\":/marginalia/hs-bz-definition-garifuna culture. I had never heard of the Garifuna before, but in the little I learned reading up before this voyage, I was curious to learn more.\r\n\r\nThe Garifuna people call themselves the Garinagu, and most live along the coast of Belize and several other \"Central American\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-central-america countries. Some, of course, have since moved all over the world; both \"Los Angeles\":/marginalia/hs-definition-los-angeles and \"New York City\":/marginalia/hs-definition-new-york-city have notable Garifuna communities. No matter where they are today, though, the Garifuna can trace their roots across the Atlantic Ocean to a single, somewhat random, occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn the 1600s, two Spanish slave ships from West Africa crashed off the shore of \"St. Vincent\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-st-vincent. The survivors were brought to St. Vincent by the \"Carib Indians\":/marginalia/hs-bz-definition-carib-indians. What happened next is murky, as most of their history was passed down through oral traditions. We do know that these West Africans fought with the native Carib Indians at first, but soon joined together when French and British settlers arrived. The West Africans soon mixed with and married members of the indigenous population and created a new ethnicity: the Garifuna.\r\n\r\nToday, the Garifuna have their own customs, cuisine, music, and language. I couldn&rsquo;t help but be amazed that so many different traditions still exist, considering there are only about 600,000 Garifuna in the whole world today.\r\n\r\nAs part of my Garifuna cultural immersion crash-course, I learned to make cassava bread. This is a staple of traditional Garifuna cooking, and forms a cornerstone of their diet. Cassava is a root vegetable that is similar to a potato, and many Caribbean cultures have incorporated its starchy qualities into their cuisines. To make it into bread, it is grated, squeezed dry, sifted, and finally cooked flat on a hot stove. The result is a crunchy bread that resembles a pita, and doesn&rsquo;t carry much flavor of its own. Cassava bread also doesn&rsquo;t have many nutrients, so it&rsquo;s typically served with other dishes, like a fish and coconut soup. Like a lot of breads and starches, it&rsquo;s mostly used to help you feel full, and to stretch more expensive ingredients into a full meal.\r\n\r\nMusic and dance also play an important part of Garifuna culture. Arguably, the most culturally significant dance is the Jankunu, which is usually performed at Christmas time. For this dance, male Garifuna dancers wear brightly-colored headdresses, strings of shells on their knees that rattle as they dance, and mostly white clothing. The costume represents a white European colonial master, and the aim of the dance is to mimic and mock the Europeans in a fast and intense drumbeat-driven dance. Not just fun to watch, the dance is filled with stories and meanings. It tells parts of the history of the Garifuna by mixing in African dances and rhythms, while also alluding to the history of colonialism in the Caribbean.

About 40% of the country&rsquo;s national space is protected, including the 185-foot long barrier reef off its coast. The coral reef is essential to Belize&rsquo;s ecological balance. It helps protect the coast from erosion, which could destroy the other habitats on land.\r\n\r\nThe crystal blue waters off the coast of Belize make it a popular destination for water sports. However, the government does have strict rules in place to make sure that the fragile coral reef is not destroyed by divers, snorkelers, and boaters.\r\n\r\nSince Belize&rsquo;s Barrier Reef is one of the world&rsquo;s most popular \"scuba\":/marginalia/hs-definition-scuba and snorkeling spots, I slipped on some flippers, put on goggles, and jumped into the clear blue waters. I was instantly surrounded by giant grouper (a rather unattractive fish) and a lone endangered sea turtle slowly swam not ten feet away from me! But, Shark Ray Alley was the most exciting part of my snorkeling adventure.\r\n\r\nShark Ray Alley provides a home to dozens of rather harmless, but very large nurse sharks. Nurse sharks get their name from the sucking noise they make while eating fish, shrimp, and squid. It is a common misconception that nurse sharks don&rsquo;t have teeth, making them a safe option for a swimming partner. In fact, nurse sharks DO have teeth, but their very low energy makes them uninterested in attacking. They even prey on sleeping fish at night to avoid the trouble of chasing their meal! &lsquo;Man-eaters&rsquo; or not, swimming with these sharks was terrifying. They can be as big as 14-feet, I definitely held my breath while I swam next to them. \r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ve encountered enormous wonders during this adventure; rainforest canopies, vast cave systems, and towering pyramids. But, for me, some of Belize&rsquo;s greatest surprises came in the tiniest of packages. \r\n\r\nThe iridescent Blue Morpho is just one of the many teeny wonders this country holds. Found throughout \"M&eacute;xico\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-mexico and South America, these butterflies are masters of disguise. When they fold shut, the Blue Morpho&rsquo;s wings are grey and brown. This serves as camouflage from predators and allows them to blend in with tree bark in the jungle. When they open their wings, though, they reveal a brilliant sheen of electric blue.

About 40% of the country&rsquo;s national space is protected, including the 185-foot long barrier reef off its coast. The coral reef is essential to Belize&rsquo;s ecological balance. It helps protect the coast from erosion, which could destroy the other habitats on land.</p>\n\n	<p>The crystal blue waters off the coast of Belize make it a popular destination for water sports. However, the government does have strict rules in place to make sure that the fragile coral reef is not destroyed by divers, snorkelers, and boaters.</p>\n\n	<p>Since Belize&rsquo;s Barrier Reef is one of the world&rsquo;s most popular <a href=\"/marginalia/hs-definition-scuba\">scuba</a> and snorkeling spots, I slipped on some flippers, put on goggles, and jumped into the clear blue waters. I was instantly surrounded by giant grouper (a rather unattractive fish) and a lone endangered sea turtle slowly swam not ten feet away from me! But, Shark Ray Alley was the most exciting part of my snorkeling adventure.</p>\n\n	<p>Shark Ray Alley provides a home to dozens of rather harmless, but very large nurse sharks. Nurse sharks get their name from the sucking noise they make while eating fish, shrimp, and squid. It is a common misconception that nurse sharks don&rsquo;t have teeth, making them a safe option for a swimming partner. In fact, nurse sharks DO have teeth, but their very low energy makes them uninterested in attacking. They even prey on sleeping fish at night to avoid the trouble of chasing their meal! &lsquo;Man-eaters&rsquo; or not, swimming with these sharks was terrifying. They can be as big as 14-feet, I definitely held my breath while I swam next to them. </p>\n\n	<p>I&rsquo;ve encountered enormous wonders during this adventure; rainforest canopies, vast cave systems, and towering pyramids. But, for me, some of Belize&rsquo;s greatest surprises came in the tiniest of packages. </p>\n\n	<p>The iridescent Blue Morpho is just one of the many teeny wonders this country holds. Found throughout <a href=\"/marginalia/hs-country-profile-mexico\">M&eacute;xico</a> and South America, these butterflies are masters of disguise. When they fold shut, the Blue Morpho&rsquo;s wings are grey and brown. This serves as camouflage from predators and allows them to blend in with tree bark in the jungle. When they open their wings, though, they reveal a brilliant sheen of electric blue. This effect is caused by microscopic scales in their wings which catch and reflect sun&rsquo; light to create contrast, and attract mates.</p>\n\n	<p>The nearly weightless Blue Morpho plays an important role in the ecosystem here.

In 2008, over 80 percent of Costa Rica&rsquo;s energy was generated through renewable resources. In addition to its &ldquo;green pledge&rdquo; Costa Rica&rsquo;s government protects over 25% of its land.\r\n\r\nOne example of this protected land is Palo Verde National Park, located in the northwest part of the country. This massive park covers more than 45,000 acres, which is about three times larger than the island of Manhattan in \"New York City\":/marginalia/hs-definition-new-york-city.

From the colorful flight of macaw to the laughing call of the toucan, this country is home to a wide variety of brilliant bird species, and today, I got up close with world&rsquo;s smallest bird - the hummingbird!\r\n\r\nHummingbirds are perfectly adapted to flight, being light, aerodynamic, and strong. Their bodies consist of nearly 1/3 flight muscles, with feathers making up most of what&rsquo;s left.\r\n\r\nMost of a hummingbird&rsquo;s time is spent in flight, and because of this, they haven&rsquo;t developed much strength in their feet.

To help, I meet with John Kani at the Apartheid Museum. \r\n\r\nIn school, I learned that the U.S. Civil Rights Movement was similar to the struggle against Apartheid. The two are very different, and Dr. Kani explains both to me. In the United States, those fighting in the Civil Rights Movement wanted equality. African-Americans weren&rsquo;t to allowed vote. Buses, restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, and even schools were segregated.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, the system denied non-whites these things as well, but Apartheid was founded on the idea of completely separating racial groups. Under the laws of the \"National Party\":/marginalia/ms-za-definition-national-party, blacks suffered the most.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa started similarly to America. In both countries, Dutch and British powers claimed lands that belonged to native populations. When the Europeans arrived in South Africa in the 17th century, informal laws began to restrict travel by native people. Laws also controlled where they could live. \"Blacks, coloured, and Indians\":/marginalia/ms-za-definition-black saw their rights quickly being taken away in 1948. By the mid 1900s, the Apartheid government didn&rsquo;t consider blacks to be human beings. \r\n\r\nThe end of Apartheid happened during my lifetime.

To help, I meet with John Kani at the Apartheid Museum. </p>\n\n	<p>In school, I learned that the U.S. Civil Rights Movement was similar to the struggle against Apartheid. The two are very different, and Dr. Kani explains both to me. In the United States, those fighting in the Civil Rights Movement wanted equality. African-Americans weren&rsquo;t to allowed vote. Buses, restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, and even schools were segregated.</p>\n\n	<p>In South Africa, the system denied non-whites these things as well, but Apartheid was founded on the idea of completely separating racial groups. Under the laws of the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-za-definition-national-party\">National Party</a>, blacks suffered the most.</p>\n\n	<p>South Africa started similarly to America. In both countries, Dutch and British powers claimed lands that belonged to native populations. When the Europeans arrived in South Africa in the 17th century, informal laws began to restrict travel by native people. Laws also controlled where they could live. <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-za-definition-black\">Blacks, coloured, and Indians</a> saw their rights quickly being taken away in 1948. By the mid 1900s, the Apartheid government didn&rsquo;t consider blacks to be human beings. </p>\n\n	<p>The end of Apartheid happened during my lifetime.

About 40% of the country&rsquo;s national space is protected, including the 185-foot long barrier reef off its coast. The coral reef is vital to Belize&rsquo;s ecological balance.

But, Shark Ray Alley was the most exciting part of my snorkeling adventure.\r\n\r\nShark Ray Alley provides a home to dozens of rather harmless, but very large nurse sharks. Nurse sharks get their name from the sucking noise they make while eating fish, shrimp, and squid. It is a common misconception that nurse sharks don&rsquo;t have teeth, making them a safe option for a swimming partner.

But, for me, some of Belize&rsquo;s greatest surprises came in the tiniest of packages. \r\n\r\nThe Blue Morpho is just one of the many teeny wonders this country has to offer. Found throughout \"M&eacute;xico\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-mexico and South America, these butterflies are masters of disguise. When they fold shut, the Blue Morpho&rsquo;s wings are grey and brown. This serves as camouflage from predators and allows them to blend in with tree bark in the jungle. When they open their wings, though, they reveal a brilliant sheen of electric blue. This effect is caused by microscopic scales in their wings which catch and reflect sun&rsquo; light to create contrast, and attract mates.\r\n\r\nBlue Morpho plays an important role in the ecosystem here. Like bees, they carry pollen between plants and help them reproduce. Once you begin too see how nature is connected from ocean to land, from reefs to trees, it&rsquo;s easy to understand the importance of conservation.','	<p>Visitors come to <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-belize\">Belize</a> from around the world to experience nature here as they&rsquo;ve never seen it before, and my visit is no exception!</p>\n\n	<p>The government of Belize takes environmental protection seriously.

They can be as big as 14-feet, and I definitely held my breath while I swam next to them. </p>\n\n	<p>I&rqsuo;ve come across enormous wonders during this adventure: rainforest canopies, vast cave systems, and towering pyramids.

Found throughout <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-mexico\">M&eacute;xico</a> and South America, these butterflies are masters of disguise. When they fold shut, the Blue Morpho&rsquo;s wings are grey and brown. This serves as camouflage from predators and allows them to blend in with tree bark in the jungle. When they open their wings, though, they reveal a brilliant sheen of electric blue. This effect is caused by microscopic scales in their wings which catch and reflect sun&rsquo; light to create contrast, and attract mates.</p>\n\n	<p>Blue Morpho plays an important role in the ecosystem here. Like bees, they carry pollen between plants and help them reproduce.

Elizabeth was technically third in line to the throne after her half-brother Edward and her half-sister Mary. After the death of both her half-siblings she succeeded to the throne in November of 1558.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth I ruled over England and Ireland for 45 years in what is considered a golden age in British history. During her reign the Church of England was established which combined the doctrines of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. She also commissioned numerous voyages of discovery around the world, particularly to the Americas, and launched Great Britain into an age of colonization and trade which would continue long after her reign. She recognized the possibilities of this age by establishing the East India Trading Company in 1600.\r\n\r\nIn Elizabeth&rsquo;s royal court the arts were encouraged. She would host numerous plays by playwrights such as William Shakespeare, therefore theaters experienced a boom in popularity.\r\n\r\nAlthough historians consider her reign a success Queen Elizabeth I did not rule without problems. Spain and France threatened to invade England in the late part of the 16th century.

Along with Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisilu, Tambo created the ANC Youth League in 1940. Straying from the previous tactics of the political party, the Youth League called for a change in fighting the Apartheid regime. Instead of simple petitions, Tambo advocated boycotts, protests, and acts of civil disobedience under the ANC&rsquo;s newly formed Programme of Action.\r\n\r\nDuring the Sharpeville Massacre of 1960, police opened fire on protestors, killing dozens of Apartheid resistors.

To prepare kebabs, meat is marinated in a blend of spices and herbs. Then, it is placed on a skewer, grilled, and served with bread. </p>\n\n	<p>Food is an important part of Azeri culture. A meal traditionally includes several different courses including appetizers, bread, soup, main dishes, desserts, and tea. This means that once you sit down, you&rsquo;d better be ready to settle in for at least an hour. </p>','','','','azerbaijan','',0,'',0,4,1,1,'upper-elementary','','','azeri-kitchen','56478574','69103929','56479222','Jenny','','','','','','','611653b7834054fb2f42ab4522403b35','2014-03-27'),

However, the \"Zambian\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-zambia landscape is very diverse, with woodlands, riverbanks, savannas, and swamp areas.  As I set out on safari in South Luangwa National Park, my senses were wide open, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells.\r\n\r\nSouth Luangwa National Park lies near the eastern border of Zambia, and is home to 60 different animal \"species\":/marginalia/ms-definition-species and more than 400 types of birds. Now that sounds like a bird-lover&rsquo;s paradise!  My fellow travellers and I set off by jeep with our guides early in the morning and didn&rsquo;t have to travel far before we came upon impala, water buffalo, zebras, and long-horned kudu. As we passed the riverbanks, I could see hippos&rsquo; ears and nostrils break the water&rsquo;s surface. Even though they seem like adorable creatures, hippopotamuses actually kill more people per year than lions, elephants, and crocodiles combined!\r\n\r\nAlthough it was exciting to see Zambia&rsquo;s wildlife from the jeep, part of our safari included a walking portion. As I jumped out of the jeep with our guides, I was a little nervous about walking where lions and elephants roam freely, but it did feel wonderful to stretch my legs after the bumpy jeep ride.  Our guides showed me how to track different animals by the size of their footprints, evidence from where they had been feeding, and even from what they left behind!  \r\n\r\nOne of my favorite moments on safari was coming face to face with the rare Thornicroft Giraffe.  Also known as the Rhodesian Giraffe, the Thornicroft Giraffe is native to eastern Zambia. Only about 1,500 members of this subspecies exist, making it one of the most endangered animal populations in the world.  The Thornicroft Giraffe is truly a magnificent creature, with its star-shaped pattern and rich coloring, but if something is not done to protect them soon, future generations may not be able to enjoy these tall mammals.\r\n','	<p>When I imagine the African landscape, I often think of wide plains covered by wildlife and vegetation.

However, over the course of my South Africa adventure I have come to I realize this massive continent has an incredibly diverse landscape, flora, and fauna.\r\n\r\nTable Mountain in \"Cape Town\":/marginalia/hs-za-definition-cape-town is one of the most recognized landmarks in the entire world; distinguished by its long, flat top. The mountain attracts tourists from all over the world, including some famous faces like Queen Elizabeth II, Tina Turner, and Jackie Chan. And, with Robben Island just a few miles from the coast of Cape Town, it served as a symbol of hope for \"Nelson Mandela\":/marginalia/hs-za-definition-nelson-mandela throughout his imprisonment.\r\n\r\nHiking to the top of Table Mountain is quite popular amongst locals and tourists alike. The steep trek takes approximately three hours from base to summit and requires a great deal of stamina. My shoulders heavy with camera equipment, I decide against the exhausting hike in favor of something easier. Luckily on October 4, 1929, the cableway opened, allowing visitors to take a quick 5-minute journey to the top. To date, the cableway has transported over sixteen million people to the lofty plateau.\r\n\r\nPeeking over the edge, my eyes follow the beautiful coastline - punctuated by tiny houses and what seemed like a sea of lush green vegetation. Sitting at the foot of Table Mountain&rsquo;s eastern slopes is Kirstenbosch Garden. Founded in 1913, the garden is home to over 7,000 plants and flowers, its goal is to preserve and protect native species.\r\n\r\nThe garden is largely occupied by a plant species called \"fynbos\":/marginalia/hs-za-definition-fynbos. With its leathery, needle-like leaves, fynbos is rather unremarkable in appearance. However, fire is a critical part of its survival, as intense heat triggers the release of their seeds in order to germinate and flower. Moreover, a fire can help return important nutrients and minerals to the soil from other plants, providing a fertile environment for fynbos to grow. That&rsquo;s unbelievable - these plants need to be set on fire in order to live!\r\n  \r\nCape Town, with its iconic mountain, verdant gardens, and picturesque waterfront, is a &ldquo;must-see&rdquo; on many world travellers lists, no trip to South Africa would be complete without a safari. For this, the final leg of my adventure, I travel to the north-east of the country near the Swaziland border.\r\n\r\nAfrica&rsquo;s sun can be blistering, which is why most animals nap and lie low during the heat of the day. I wake at 5:30am daily and climb into an open-topped jeep in search of active wildlife. With the ranger and tracker on the lookout, I see kudu, giraffes, lots of warthogs, wildebeest, springbok, and even rhino. Watching a herd of elephants at a watering hole not more than ten feet away is one of the coolest experiences of my life. I never imagined being so close to an uncaged, untrained elephant.\r\n\r\nBy the end of my 5-day safari experience, I spot four the Big Five; sadly, the elusive leopards stays hidden.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m in awe sheer natural beauty this country possesses, and  discover during my adventure and have a new appreciation for how fragile our Earth is.

Those who did not die from disease were forced to abandon their culture and take on the ways of the British.\r\n\r\nOver the next 100 years, Sydney continued to grow as more immigrants from Britain and Ireland moved to Australia. Slowly, Australia began to make amends with the ancestors of those indigenous people who were mistreated in the earlier years.

Those who did not die from disease were forced to abandon their culture and take on the ways of the British.</p>\n\n	<p>Over the next 100 years, Sydney continued to grow as more immigrants from Britain and Ireland moved to Australia. Slowly, Australia began to make amends with the ancestors of those indigenous people who were mistreated in the earlier years.

This new way of learning about current events spread quickly.</p>\n\n	<p>Television service arrived in 1936, but it didn&rsquo;t last long. TV programming was suspended when World War II broke out and didn&rsquo;t resume until 1946. Thankfully, radio broadcasts continued to help keep citizens up to date. Once the war ended and television programs were allowed again, the popularity of TV grew enormously, and the <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> continued growing its influence.</p>\n\n	<p>Why is the <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> so popular outside of England? In 1932, the <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> Empire Service was launched with broadcasts aimed at English speakers living in overseas territories of the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-british-empire\">British Empire</a>. And, as we&rsquo;ve learned, the British Empire covered a lot of the globe.</p>\n\n	<p>In 1965, the <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> Empire Service changed its name to the <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> World Service. Today, millions of people around the world tune in to the <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> on television, on the radio, and online. As I travel throughou parts of former British Empire, I&rsquo;m sure that the <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> will be how I stay up to date on current events!</p>','A quick history of the BBC.

Pomegranates are an example of this: while they are a rarity in other areas of the world, they are a typical fruit in Azerbaijan, where they grow in the country&rsquo;s tropical regions. Their taste is tangy but sweet, and their seeds offer an intriguing texture to every dish. \r\n\r\nFresh herbs are also common in Azeri cooking. You&rsquo;ll find mint, dill, basil, parsley, and tarragon in many Azeri lamb and seafood dishes. Even though it&rsquo;s considered exotic and expensive in America, saffron is a popular spice here. This bright yellow seasoning comes from a type of flower, and it&rsquo;s used in more than 50 of the country&rsquo;s popular dishes.\r\n\r\nSince Azerbaijan is bordered to the west by the Caspian Sea, fish are a prevalent part of the cuisine, too.

However, in tropical areas it can grow year round. Rice usually requires plenty of water, so it&rsquo;s often grown in regions with high annual rainfall.

Surely, it would require dozens of journal entries for me to share all I have learned about this intriguing country. Instead, I will focus on a smaller snapshot of India&rsquo;s recent past: British India.\r\n\r\nHow (and why) did the British come to control this land? To understand that, we must first go back to the \"Age of Exploration.\":/marginalia/ms-definition-age-of-exploration During this time period many of Europe&rsquo;s royal powers sent expeditions around the world in search of valuable trade routes and territories rich in natural resources. In 1600, \"Queen Elizabeth I\":/marginalia/ms-definition-queen-elizabeth-I granted a \"Royal Charter\":/marginalia/ms-definition-royal-charter to the \"British East India Company\":/marginalia/ms-definition-east-india-company to establish trade relations in India.\r\n\r\nThe British East India Company soon became the major power in India, overtaking \"Portuguese\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-portugal, \"Dutch\":/marginalia/ms-country-profile-netherlands, and French trade interests in the region. By the 1800s, this company had gained a monopoly over goods such as tea, spices, silk, and cotton. The British East India Company built its own private military, using local Indians as &ldquo;sepoys,&rdquo; or paid militiamen, to help establish order and control across India.\r\n\r\nBy 1857, growing frustration with the ruling the British East India Company led many of these sepoys to revolt against the British. This revolt became known as the \"Indian Rebellion of 1857\":/marginalia/ms-definition-indian-rebellion-of-1857.

Surely, it would require dozens of journal entries for me to share all I have learned about this intriguing country. Instead, I will focus on a smaller snapshot of India&rsquo;s recent past: British India.</p>\n\n	<p>How (and why) did the British come to control this land? To understand that, we must first go back to the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-age-of-exploration\">Age of Exploration.</a> During this time period many of Europe&rsquo;s royal powers sent expeditions around the world in search of valuable trade routes and territories rich in natural resources. In 1600, <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-queen-elizabeth-I\">Queen Elizabeth I</a> granted a <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-royal-charter\">Royal Charter</a> to the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-east-india-company\">British East India Company</a> to establish trade relations in India.</p>\n\n	<p>The British East India Company soon became the major power in India, overtaking <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-portugal\">Portuguese</a>, <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-country-profile-netherlands\">Dutch</a>, and French trade interests in the region. By the 1800s, this company had gained a monopoly over goods such as tea, spices, silk, and cotton. The British East India Company built its own private military, using local Indians as &ldquo;sepoys,&rdquo; or paid militiamen, to help establish order and control across India.</p>\n\n	<p>By 1857, growing frustration with the ruling the British East India Company led many of these sepoys to revolt against the British. This revolt became known as the <a href=\"/marginalia/ms-definition-indian-rebellion-of-1857\">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a>. Wanting to protect their business in India, the British government cancelled the British East India Company&rsquo;s charter, and established its own rule over India.

He directs me deeper into the market, where I soon find myself learning more about the ancient tradition of mehndi.\r\n\r\nMehndi is a tradition of body art that uses a natural, plant-based paste called henna to dye the skin.

Sometimes, the name of the groom will be painted into the designs. It&rsquo;s said that the darker the mehndi becomes, the more a groom loves his new wife, but I have a feeling the deep brown color is derived from chemical processes!\r\n\r\nEven though I&rsquo;s not celebrating a festive occasion, I decide that I want to experience mehndi. The paste tickles a bit as it is applied by an artist over my hands and arms, but I am mesmerized by the beauty of each design and pattern.

Maybe $20 if the tulip is really special? Would you believe that 400 years ago a tulip was worth as much as a house? Yes, this really happened when &ldquo;Tulip Mania&rdquo; took over the \"Netherlands\":/marginalia/ue-country-profile-netherlands in the 1630s. \r\n\r\nHistorians think the tulip was first brought to the Netherlands from \"Turkey\":/marginalia/ue-country-profile-turkey in 1593. The Dutch fell in love with this new flower, but the colorful tulip was scarce. When something is &lsquo;scarce&rsquo; it means there isn&rsquo;t enough available. During Tulip Mania, lots of people wanted tulips. This is called &lsquo;Demand.&rsquo; But, there weren&rsquo;t many tulips around, so the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo; was low.\r\n\r\nWhen Demand is higher than Supply, people are willing to pay more and the price goes up. So, what if you had a scarce tulip in the Netherlands in 1636? Let&rsquo;s investigate.\r\n\r\nImagine you start to grow a tulip bulb. One day, your friend Jenny comes to visit and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you $100 for that flower. I don&rsquo;t want it now but when it blooms next year, it&rsquo;s mine. Here&rsquo;s $100 and a Contract for you to sign. It says that the holder of the Contract owns this tulip.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBut Jenny does not really want your flower. So, why did Jenny buy it? Because, she thinks she can sell the Contract to Zoe for $200. Wait‚Ä¶how could Jenny sell the tulip if you are still growing it? \r\n\r\nRemember the Contract? You signed the Contract promising to give your tulip to whoever shows up at your door in 12 months. Jenny didn&rsquo;t sell the flower itself, she sold the Contract!\r\n\r\nFor $200, Zoe now owns that Contract. She has two choices. She can keep the Contract and collect your tulip, or she can sell the Contract.\r\n\r\nZoe decides to sell the Contract. She finds a buyer, and this buyer finds another buyer who finds another buyer, then another. Each time the Contract goes from one buyer to the next, it sells for a higher price. There is such a high demand for tulips that everyone expects the price will keep going up.\r\n\r\nIn the year since you first sold your tulip to Jenny it went from $100 to $250,000. Then one day, disaster! The tulip is no longer worth $250,000, but far less. The problem, you see, is the &lsquo;Demand&rsquo; has suddenly disappeared. There are no buyers at such high prices. So, what happens now? \r\n\r\nDavid is the last person who bought the contract. He paid $250,000 thinking he could sell it for even more money. But, the price has dropped a lot and David has just lost most of his money. OUCH!\r\n\r\nIn all this buying and selling, Jenny, Zoe, and David are called &lsquo;speculators.&rsquo; They are betting on the future price. Speculators plan to make a profit from the increase in price. Sometimes it works out, like it did for Jenny and Zoe, but sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. The story did not end well for David. \r\n\r\nAnd, yes, Tulip Mania really happened!','	<p>How much would you pay for a tulip? $3, $5? Maybe $20 if the tulip is really special?

So, what happens now? </p>\n\n	<p>David is the last person who bought the contract. He paid $250,000 thinking he could sell it for even more money. But, the price has dropped a lot and David has just lost most of his money. <span class=\"caps\">OUCH</span>!</p>\n\n	<p>In all this buying and selling, Jenny, Zoe, and David are called &lsquo;speculators.&rsquo; They are betting on the future price.

Maybe $20, but it would have to be very special. Would you believe 400 years ago, some tulips were worth the equivalent of a lavish house? When &lsquo;Tulip Mania&rsquo; took over the \"Netherlands\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-netherlands in the mid 1630s, this really happened.  \r\n\r\nThe Dutch were pioneers in shipping, trade, and commerce in the 1600s. The Netherlands was a rich country and people liked to decorate with exotic and rare flowers. They fell in love with tulips! Historians believe the flower was first introduced from \"Turkey\":/marginalia/hs-country-profile-turkey. Bright and colorful, the tulip was new, and prized because it was scarce. \r\n\r\nSuppose that 1,000 people want tulips but only 10 are available, what happens to the price of tulips? Well it goes up, probably a lot! This is called &lsquo;the law of supply and demand&rsquo; and it applies to anything which is bought and sold. If you had a tulip in the Netherlands in 1635, you could make a lot of money ‚Äì more even than a nice house in her capital city, \"Amsterdam\":/marginalia/hs-definition-amsterdam. Sure, it&rsquo;s not gold or something of practical use, but the demand for tulips at that time was much higher than supply so the price just kept skyrocketing. How could this happen for a simple flower? Well, if everyone expects the price of something to keep going up then you can make money just by holding on to it. In fact, you can even make money by agreeing to sell something in the future, even before it exists (this is called a &lsquo;futures market&rsquo;.) \r\n\r\nHere&rsquo;s how it worked back in 1600s Netherlands: Imagine you begin to grow a tulip bulb in 1636, the height of Tulip Mania. When it blooms in 12 months, it&rsquo;s going to be worth a lot of money. Just then, your friend Jenny visits and says, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ll pay you $100 now for that flower and when it blooms next year it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; You sign a Contract and the deal is done. You get cash now for a flower that doesn&rsquo;t exist yet and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about selling it later (of course, if the tulip doesn&rsquo;t bloom at all you have to give back the $100.)\r\n\r\nBut Jenny didn&rsquo;t really want the tulip for herself, even though it will be very pretty. Wait, what? Why did Jenny buy it if she didn&rsquo;t want it? Basically, Jenny is betting that the price of the flower in one year will be much more than $100, and she will make a profit. However, it gets even weirder! Because Jenny paid $100 for a tulip &lsquo;Contract&rsquo; (remember the tulip doesn&rsquo;t even exist yet) then she can sell the Contract to Zoe who is willing to pay $200 for it because she bets it will be worth even more money in the future.\r\n\r\nZoe now has two choices. She can either keep the Contract and collect your tulip when grown or she can sell the Contract and try to make even more money, just like Jenny did. Zoe decides to sell to another buyer, and that buyer will sell to another buyer. Every time the Contract is sold, the price for the &lsquo;future&rsquo; flower increases. The technical term for this is &lsquo;speculation.&rsquo; Every buyer is speculating about what the future price will be when the tulip blooms.\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s February 1637, and your tulip is now fully grown. Whoever holds the Contract is now the proud owner of your tulip. Who will show up at your door? Not Jenny, not Zoe, but somebody you never heard of called David. He was at the end of a chain of buyers and he paid ‚Äì wait for it! - $250,000! That&rsquo;s an incredible amount of money and all of the buyers along the way have made a nice profit on selling the Contract. The question now is ‚Äì &ldquo;how much is the tulip really worth today?&rdquo; You can be sure that David is really nervous! He stands to make a lot of money if the price has gone up even more or lose a fortune if his guess was wrong.\r\n\r\nWell, the bad news for David is that the price of tulips dropped like a stone in early 1637 and his lovely tulip is now worth only a few hundred dollars ‚Äì he is ruined! This really happened in the Netherlands in 1637 and this is the first example in history of what is known as an &lsquo;economic bubble&rsquo; ‚Äì a period of frenzied speculation when everyone thinks the value of something will keep going up and up‚Ä¶. until the bubble pops and the price comes crashing down. No wonder it was called &lsquo;Tulip Mania!&rsquo; But don&rsquo;t get the idea this is something historical ‚Äì bubbles have happened in recent years with company shares, real estate, precious metals‚Ä¶ it can happen with basically anything. \r\n\r\nOk...since there is a risk of bubbles like Tulip Mania, why would anybody want to do futures trading? Let&rsquo;s ask Old MacDonald.\r\n\r\nOld MacDonald grows corn. Today, he can pay for seed and fertilizer, but he has no idea how much the corn will sell for when it&rsquo;s finally grown. If he makes a contract now for his future corn, he knows exactly how much money he&rsquo;ll get when he harvests his corn. This gives him confidence to spend the money he needs on seed corn, fertilizer, labor and so on. He is a farmer, after all, and not a speculator! The contract he signed may be sold on to others in the &lsquo;Futures Market&rsquo; and there are speculators who buy and sell corn contracts in this market just like Jenny and Zoe sold the Tulip Contract. The farmer gets a stable price ahead of time and the traders can make a profit by selling for more money than they paid. \r\n\r\nThanks to those Dutch pioneers, we now have sophisticated Futures Markets. Farmers, miners, shareholders, real-estate builders and so on can get stable prices when they need to make investment decisions. There are Futures Markets in corn, pork bellies, cattle, wheat, in fact, just about anything! It works very well‚Ä¶unless things get out of hand. Just watch out for those bubbles!\r\n','	<p>What would you pay for a tulip? $3? $5? Maybe $20, but it would have to be very special.

Bright and colorful, the tulip was new, and prized because it was scarce. </p>\n\n	<p>Suppose that 1,000 people want tulips but only 10 are available, what happens to the price of tulips? Well it goes up, probably a lot! This is called &lsquo;the law of supply and demand&rsquo; and it applies to anything which is bought and sold. If you had a tulip in the Netherlands in 1635, you could make a lot of money. The demand for tulips at that time was much higher than supply so the price just kept shooting up.</p>\n\n	<p>How could this happen for a simple flower? Well, if everyone expects the price of something to keep going up then you can make money just by holding on to it. In fact, you can even make money by agreeing to sell something in the future, even before it exists. This is called a &lsquo;futures market&rsquo;. </p>\n\n	<p>Here&rsquo;s how it worked back in 1600s Netherlands: Imagine you begin to grow a tulip bulb in 1636, the height of Tulip Mania. When it blooms in 12 months, it&rsquo;s going to be worth a lot of money. Just then, your friend Jenny visits and says, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ll pay you $100 right now for that flower and when it blooms next year it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; You sign a Contract and the deal is done. You get cash now for a flower that doesn&rsquo;t exist yet and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about selling it later. Of course, if the tulip doesn&rsquo;t bloom at all you have to give back the $100.</p>\n\n	<p>But Jenny didn&rsquo;t really want the tulip for herself, even though it will be very pretty. Wait, what? Why did Jenny buy it if she didn&rsquo;t want it? Jenny is betting that the price of the flower in one year will be much more than $100, and she will make a profit. However, it gets even weirder! Because Jenny paid $100 for a tulip &lsquo;Contract&rsquo; (remember the tulip doesn&rsquo;t even exist yet) then she can sell the Contract to Zoe who is willing to pay $200 for it because she bets it will be worth even more money in the future.</p>\n\n	<p>Zoe now has two choices. She can either keep the Contract and collect your tulip when grown or she can sell the Contract and try to make even more money, just like Jenny did. Zoe decides to sell to another buyer, and that buyer will sell to another buyer. Every time the Contract is sold, the price for the &lsquo;future&rsquo; flower increases. The word for all this buying and selling is &lsquo;speculation.&rsquo; Every buyer is speculating about what the future price will be when the tulip blooms.</p>\n\n	<p>It&rsquo;s February 1637, and your tulip is now fully grown. Whoever holds the Contract is now the proud owner of your tulip. Who will show up at your door? Not Jenny, not Zoe, but somebody you never heard of called David. He was at the end of a long line of buyers and he paid ‚Äì wait for it! &#8211; $250,000! That&rsquo;s an incredible amount of money and all of the buyers along the way have made a nice profit on selling the Contract. The question now is ‚Äì &ldquo;how much is the tulip really worth today?&rdquo; You can be sure that David is really nervous! He could make a lot of money if the price has gone up even more or lose a fortune if his guess was wrong.</p>\n\n	<p>Well, the bad news for David is that the price of tulips dropped fast in early 1637.  His lovely tulip is now worth only a few hundred dollars ‚Äì he is ruined! This really happened in the Netherlands in 1637 and this is the first example in history of what is known as an &lsquo;economic bubble&rsquo; ‚Äì a period when everyone thinks the value of something will keep going up and up‚Ä¶. until the bubble pops and the price comes crashing down. </p>\n\n	<p>No wonder it was called &lsquo;Tulip Mania!&rsquo; But don&rsquo;t get the idea this is something historical. Bubbles have happened several time in recent years&#8230;it can happen with basically anything that can be bought and sold.</p>','','','','netherlands','',0,'',0,4,1,1,'middle-school','','','tulip-mania','208575666','216437188','','Zoe','','','','','','','0a7c892bf76cfc888de9349f6e9a122f','2017-04-28'),

As a young man, he worked briefly as an art dealer and a teacher before following in his father&rsquo;s footsteps and becoming a Protestant \"missionary\":/marginalia/hs-definition-missionary. However, he often suffered from depression, and didn&rsquo;t settle in any of these jobs.\r\n\r\nVan Gogh took up painting when he was 27. He soon moved to Paris where he joined a loose group of artists, known as the &lsquo;avant-garde&rsquo;, who were known for being experimental. His brother, Theo, offered emotional and financial support and this allowed Vincent to devote himself entirely to making art. The two would exchange many letters and it was Theo who introduced Vincent to other artists, including the famous Paul Gauguin.\r\n\r\nVan Gogh was overjoyed when Gauguin moved into his house in Arles, a city in the south of France, in 1888. It was during this period that the artist worked on two series of still-life paintings called Sunflowers. Van Gogh&rsquo;s paintings of sunflowers are extraordinarily vivid and emotional. He used a range of yellows and deep oranges to convey the vibrant life of the flowers and also their decay.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pair did paint together, they also argued incessantly, and Van Gogh was very anxious that his friend might leave. After one particularly painful argument, Vincent took a razor and cut off a part of his own ear. Van Gogh painted &lsquo;Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear&rsquo; (1889) when he was recovering from the incident.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of his life, Van Gogh suffered from great mental anguish and hallucinations, which led many people in Arles to consider him a madman. In 1889, he shuffled in and out of psychiatric hospitals, alternating between periods of acute depression and passionate artistic activity. The intense colours he used in his artworks reflect this dual state of anguish and joy and are perhaps represented best in his most famous work &lsquo;The Starry Night&rsquo; which he painted in 1889 while staying in an asylum.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, at just 37 years old, Van Gogh died from a self-inflicted revolver wound. In a brief period of ten years, this troubled artist had completed more than 2,100 works, consisting of 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300 watercolors, drawings, and sketches! \r\n\r\nDuring his life, he had sold only one painting. However, other artists and his brother Theo promoted his work, and today, Vincent van Gogh is considered one of the greatest artists the world has ever seen. He is the greatest Dutch painter after \"Rembrandt\":/marginalia/rembrandt-van-rijn and his paintings rank among the most expensive in the world.

How would you make a city a better place to live?  ','	<p>Before cities existed humans led very tough lives. They lived mainly in caves. They had to hunt animals and forage (or find) plants and other food to eat. </p>\n\n	<p>Then about 10,000 years ago, humans began growing plants and raising animals. This allowed larger groups of people to settle together and help each other with their basic needs. Soon, farmers provided food and other people could practice trades, such as blacksmith, weaver, potter, and carpenter. This system worked so well that small villages began to grow larger and larger, and &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; developed into cities! This all happened in Mesopotamia between 4000 and 3000 <span class=\"caps\">BCE</span>. </p>\n\n	<p>Located in the Middle East around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Mesopotamia was the location of the first city in the world!</p>\n\n	<p>Today, more than half of the world lives in cities. Many of these cities have over one million people! In the next 20-30 years, it is believed that more than 2.5 <span class=\"caps\">BILLION</span> more people will be living in cities. Think about how much food and water <span class=\"caps\">ALL</span> those people will need to eat and drink. Think about how many apartments they will need to live in, and how much energy they will use. And, what we will do with all of their garbage? Yikes! Those are big problems but luckily, there are many experts working on the case!</p>\n\n	<p><a href=\"/marginalia/ue-definition-amsterdam\">Amsterdam</a> is a city that already has some awesome solutions in action! For example, nearly everybody in Amsterdam rides bikes rather than drives cars. There are bike lanes and strict rules that make it possible for everyone to get quickly and safely where they need to go. That saves on fuel (not to mention that the exercise is so good for you)! </p>\n\n	<p>Besides Amsterdam, there are plenty of other cities with excellent solutions to the problems of city living‚Ä¶ but there&rsquo;s always a need for new ideas.

For example, the Circus Maximus (the first circus in ancient Rome), was about 1,300 feet long, 300 feet wide and could seat 250,000 people!

The modern circus is really defined by the ring - that circle of space surrounded by the audience, commanded by performers, where the magic happens. The ring idea came about in 1768, when a performing stunt rider, named Philip Astley, determined the smallest possible circumference that allowed him to comfortably ride his horse in a circle, standing up on it&rsquo;s back - a staple trick of any equestrian/human performance! He built what he called an amphitheatre (an open-air building) in London, with a 42 foot diameter ring in the center, and opened for business. Over the next couple of years, Astley figure out that he had to hire supporting acts to entertain his audience in between rides - and so the modern circus performance pattern, of alternating clowns, acrobats and jugglers, and other performers, was born.

They all come from extremely challenging backgrounds and have dedicated unimaginable time and effort to master their art and gain an education. From the second the lights go down, and the music starts, they take you skillfully through an awesome and electric Cambodian journey.
